# Tome

Tome was built with my sometimes disorganized brain in mind... I found myself constantly forgetting the titles or authors of books that were recommended to me or losing notes I'd written when I saw a book referenced in a magazine or by my son's teacher. I have always wanted one app to keep track of the books that I'm always on the hunt for whether it's in my weekly trip to the library or on a lazy meander through the local bookstore. Tome offers this along with a handy space to make note of just why I added the book to my list in the first place. Keep track of where you first heard of it, who might want to read it next, or when it needs to be in the mail to your Aunt Beth. Tome is simple, no-fuss, and utilizes the Google Books API Family to provide realiable, up to date information. Tome: What do you want to read next?

## Functionalities
Upon logging in, users may view their Reading List - complete with notes from when they originally added the book to their Reading List. They may also Search for new books, add a note (or not) and save the book to their Reading List. The list is then available for reference when they next visit the library or bookstore.
